# What is next?

Now that Redpanda is properly running in your environment, there is a lot of features and configuration that can be done to your instance.

Create an application to interact with your Redapand cluster using [NodeJS](./guide-nodejs.md).

It's recommended to add a layer of security to your environment. Applying features like [authorization and authentication](./acls.md) or [TLS encryption for Kubernetes](./tls-kubernetes.md) is highly recommended, specially in a production environment. It is important to note that changes to configuration files, not only from a local machine but also for Kubernetes and Docker require a restart of the cluster.

For Kubernetes, please check our [Kubernetes guide](./quick-start-kubernetes.md) to guide you.

For more detailed information about the RPK commands, our [RPK commands overview](./rpk-commands.md) can help you to easily configure and interact with the topics.

Another great source of Redpanda's material can be found within our [blog](./https://vectorized.io/blog), not only to technical guides but also Redpanda's announcements.
